        HiðŸ‘‹ stranger! I'm TÃ¼rkay TunÃ§, a web developer living in Istanbul/Turkey.

      <p className="max-w-5xl leading-loose text-lg md:text-2xl pt-5">
        I started working as a performance tester using built-in Unity profiler and C# language 5 years ago. For almost
        3 years, I refactored codes to increase projects' performance. At that time I also made games as an idividual
        developer from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-5xl leading-loose text-lg md:text-2xl pt-12">
        Then I decided to change my workspace to web development. I like to learn new technologies and continuously
        improve myself. My journey from game development to web development started as a frontend developer. I really
        liked web development so I decided to learn some backend and devops technologies too.

        My next goal is learning Golang wish me luck. &#128516;
